# Components

Components are the building blocks of any React Application.

A component is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can be combined with other components to build complex user interfaces.

React components allow developers to break down the UI into reusable, isolated pieces that can be put together to form complex user interfaces.

Each component:

- Encapsulates logic and UI in a single function or class.
- Can be used multiple times within a project.

There are two types of components in React:

- **Functional components**
- **Class components (deprecating)**
