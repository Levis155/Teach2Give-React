# Routing with React Router

React Router is the most popular routing library in React.

It is available for both mobile and web applications.

To use React Router on the Web, you need to run;

```console
npm install react-router-dom
```

This library specifically installs the DOM version of React Router.

If using React Native, you will need to install **react-router-native** instead.
